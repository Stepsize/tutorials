# Overview

This repo contains a set of short tutorials with code snippets describing how to use various APIs, SDKs, and libraries.

It's pretty empty at the moment but we'll be creating content right up until AnvilHack begins.

To pick up the new code snippets in the [Stepsize](http://stepsize.com/?ref=anvilhack) app as soon as they're available, just hit the sync button or reboot the app. That's it.

# Requests

If you're planning to use an API during the hackathon and would like some code snippets, don't hesitate to raise an issue and we'll try to get to it as soon as possible.

Also, make sure to +1 open requests if you also want snippets for the API in question â€“ this will help us prioritise requests.

# Contributing

If you'd like to contribute tutorials & code snippets, please feel free to go ahead and fork the repo, create your tutorial (follow the [sample structure](https://github.com/Stepsize/tutorials/blob/master/sample.md)) and submit a pull request when it's ready.

The only thing we'll need is for you to create the code snippets via the [Stepsize](http://stepsize.com/?ref=anvilhack) app and tag all of them with:
- `anvilhack`
- `<api_name>-bundle`

This will allow us to share the snippets with everyone.
