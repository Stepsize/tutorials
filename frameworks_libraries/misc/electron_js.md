# Overview

[Electron](http://electron.atom.io) is a cross platform framework built by GitHub (based on the shell used for GitHubs hackable editor [Atom](https://atom.io)). It allows you to create applications with pure JavaScript by providing a runtime with native APIs.

Electron uses web pages as it's GUI, since its built on top of the minimal [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home) browser.

# Setup

Once you start up an application using Electron, there will be a `package.json` that is read, this `package.json` will define a `main` file (typically called `main.js`), this script is called the **main process**.
