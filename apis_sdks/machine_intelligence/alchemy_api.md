This tutorial provides some code snippets for Python (using the [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) library)

# Setup

It's a plain RESTful API, just get your API key from [here](http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/register.html).


# Using AlchemyAPI

Use your favourite HTTP request library to hit the endpoints. We'll be using the [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) module. You can find a quick tutorial on it [here](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/).

They can do general sentiment of a document, you can also get the sentiment for a given company/person (say you're looking for people digging up dirt on you).
