# Overview

IBM Watson is our favourite Jeopardy-playing AI. They have some cool experimental & beta Machine Intelligence services. We'll showcase their [Tone Analyser](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/tone-analyzer.html), which is the best way at the moment to detect your snarky passive aggressive comments. It uses linguistic analysis to detect emotion, social tendencies, and language style.

This tutorial covers Python using the [`requests`](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) module.

# Setup

1. Sign-up [here](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/?Target=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.ng.bluemix.net%2Flogin).
2. Log in. (Your IBM id is just your email)
3. You will land on your dashboard page, click on Services and API and select the Tone analyser.
4. Give it any name you want (`anvil-hack` maybe?) and create the service.
5. Go to service credentials and get them.

If needed, run `pip install requests` to install the [`requests`](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) module.

# Using the API

We'll show you how to use the API using the [`requests`](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) library for Python.

To perform an analysis of a piece of text, use the following snippet. It can also be found in the [Stepsize](http://stepsize.com/?ref=anvilhack) app:

* [Tone analysis of a given text](https://gist.github.com/devStepsize/a215918ceda27dbe9b025fd6d85565b1) â€“ search for `tone analyser`
