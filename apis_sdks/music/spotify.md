# Overview

No need to introduce Spotify, they deliver music, and they sponsor hackathons.

This tutorial is a super short introduction to some of their API functionalities.

This tutorial covers retrieving albums and songs for a given artist using the [`requests`](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) library.

# Setup

Nada. None. It's an open REST API. The dream.

Every entity in the Spotify API has a unique ID.
