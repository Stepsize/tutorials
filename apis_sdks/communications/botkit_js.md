# Overview

Botkit is a toolkit for making bot applications. It's designed to ease the process of designing and running useful, creative bots that live inside Slack & Facebook Messenger.

It provides a semantic interface to sending and receiving messages so that developers can focus on creating novel applications instead of dealing with API endpoints.

It's a Node.js package available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/botkit).

# Setup

Install the Botkit [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/botkit) by running `npm install --save botkit`.

You can also check out Botkit directly from Git – see [this](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit#installation).

# Using Botkit with Stepsize

[Botkit's documentation](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit) is excellent and we highly recommend reading through it if you're considering using it for your project.

What we've done is taken their great sample code and made it available via the app so that once you've gone through the documentation and you're ready to code, you can do so without switching back and forth between your editor and browser.
